		    <p>Believed to be the oldest surviving piece of literature ever found, The Epic Of Gilgamesh is not only an excellent story, but an extremely important one as well for the history of written text. Written not as a full story, but as a series of poems, the story begins with Gilgamesh, 2/3rds god and 1/3rds man, being a mighty king that nobody could ever defeat, That is until an equal is created to challenge him, named Enkidu. Enkidu was created as a beast man who lives among the forest critters and grazes like a deer, but after learning the ways of humanity, he is rejected by the forest he once inhabited, so he instead chases destiny by deciding to duel with Gilgamesh. During the fight, Gilgamesh eventually overpowers him and throws Enkidu to the ground, but afterwards decide to become partners in adventure due to mutual respect for eachother's strength. However, Gilgamesh begins to have a series of cryptic dreams that Enkidu happens to be able to decipher, but one of their apparent meanings unsettled him: it stated he was fated to become a great hero and king, but that he would never become immortal as he had hoped for. After this dream, Gilgamesh and Enkidu decide to kill the guardian of the forest, Humbaba, to solidify Gilgamesh's destiny as a hero of legend. After a blessing from the sun god Shamash and a fight with Humbaba, the creature was reduced to groveling for its life... but trusting Enkidu's advice, Gilgamesh kills Humbaba anyways.</p>

			<img src = "Theseus.jpg" alt = "Statue of Theseus" class = "StandardImage">
		    <p>Likely the most well known hero featured in this website due to his importance within the most popular mythology (that of the Greeks), Theseus was simeltaneously the greatest Athenian hero and the greatest king, credited in myth for creating the system of democracy and beginning an era of prosperity for the city. While Theseus had many adventures and legends attributed to him, the most famous is his slaying of the Minotaur, the half-human, half-bull beast caged in an inescapable labyrinth in Crete, eating the tributes from Theseus's city-state, Athens. The king of Crete at that time, King Minos, had lost his son an heir in a reckless hunting trip in Athens, and now forces King Aegeus (Theseus's father and the king of Athens before him) to send 14 youths to be eaten by the Minotaur every 9 years. When a young Theseus arrives in Athens to find that the next roundup is happening in a few days, he volunteers himself to be one of them, planning to signal to his father if he was succesful in slaying the beast. As expected, he does, but not alone: the daughter of Minos, Ariadne, assisted him in his quest, and began to sail back home with eachother happily. However, the story does not end there: in one way or another, Ariadne is left alone on a remote island, and Theseus forgets to signal that he is on the returning ship, leading to the suicide of Aegeus and Theseus's appointment as king of Athens.</p>

		    <p>Sigurd The Volsung is a Norse legendary hero who is often credited with slaying the wicked dragon (or massive worm, depending on which account you read) Fafnir, and being the son of the equally heroic Sigmund the Volsung. Sigmund had died in battle, with his mighty sword Gram being shattered into pieces, and Sigurd, as the heir to the Volsung family, inherited the remains of the weapon, which is entirely useless to him until a dwarf, Reginn, approaches him asking for a certain favor. His father, an extremely wealthy dwarf who had previously protected his wealth with a magical ring, had died, but instead of spreading their inheritance equally, his brother Fafnir had taken all of the riches and the ring for himself, then turned into a ferocious beast to deter anyone but the strongest warrior from taking back his new-found wealth. Sigurd was convinced to accept the offer as Reginn had promised that both of the men would get a share of the wealth, and so Reginn re-forged Gram out of the remaining pieces of the sword, a weapon so powerful that it could slay Fafnir with one hit. Sigurd travels to Fafnir's layer, and through quick thinking, and a swift stab to the belly, the beast had been slain, but Reginn didn't keep his side of the bargain: after Sigurd found out that Reginn was planning to take all of the gold for himself no different than Fafnir, he decapitated the traitor and therefore collected all of the gold for himself.</p>

		    <p>Traveling further east to the mythological traditions of Japan, Yamato-Takeru, originally simply Prince Ousu, was a hero known across Japan for his cleverness and courage. The youngest of six sons of King Keiko, the emperor of ancient Japan at the time, he slayed his older brother as a teenager, and was sent to the Izumo Province (modern-day Shimane Prefecture) to fight gangs of brigands. However, he ended up succeeding, finding cunning ways to execute the brigands he was sent after: in one case, he dressed up as a maid to infiltrate a criminal drinking party, killing them after they had let down their guard. This is where he was given his name, Yamato-Takeru, translating to "The Brave of Yamato" (with Yamato being an archaic name for Japan), a name given to him by one of his enemies as they bled out to death. But when he got back, instead of being praised for his heroc actions, he was sneered at and promptly sent to somewhere else, which was the point that he realized what his father's true intentions were: Keiko feared Yamato for his strength and brutality, and wanted him dead. Upon realization, he visited his aunt Yamato-Hime in the Ise Province (modern-day Mei Prefecture), where he was given the legendary sword Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi (translating to Grass Cutting Sword)after she had heard about his troubles. After this, the hero went on to have many notable adventures, such as slaying a giant serpent terrorizing Oni Province (Shiga Prefecture), composing the first ever sedoka poem, and slaying demonic gods.</p>

			<h1 class = "StandardHeader">So What?</h1>
		    <p>While these heroes may come from entirely different sides of the world from eachother, there is no denying that they aren't at least similar in a way, despite each one being written mostly independently of the others. Firstly and most prominently, an overwhelming majority of ancient heroes were males: as myths were often written by men and endorsed by the men in power, it was essential that they displayed male dominance to support the patriarchical structure of nearly all societies at the time. Another interesting similarity is that all heroes picked on this website are royalty in one way or another, with all of them being princes at the time of their birth. This is perhaps because of the fact that mythology was chosen to be endorsed by the upper class, and naturally the high classes would want stories of the heroic deeds of their own kind. Finally, and most importantly, despite all of their heroic deeds, almost no hero is perfect: why read a myth if the hero depicted within it is one that could do no wrong? Since every human is naturally flawed due to their nature, imperfect heroes (and especially heroes that develop in character over the course of their story) make themselves, and by extension the story, more real and relatable. gitIn conclusion, distant in time, culture, and geography that they may be, heroes are written similarly in every human society, from the legends of the Aztec Empire to the traditions of the Zulu Nation. It is not just heroes that connect between different peoples, however: people are always more similar and can relate more to each other than they believe, even if it seems we don't have much in common with another.</p>

		<h2 class = "AboutText StandardHeader">About This Website</h2>
		<p class = "AboutText">Connected Heroes is a website created in one week by Florida based student and aspiring developer Danny Ortiz. Having been created in so short a time (and as the creator's first time using JavaScript), it's rough about the edges at points but communicated its point of heroes being connected figures as the creator originally intended.</p>
		<div class = "AboutLine"></div>
		<p class = "AboutText">As stated previously, this website's primary purpose is to simeltaneously gain experience in web development and show how even heroes created thousands of miles and years apart from each other are similar, but it's not just that: this website is also meant as a reference and a starting point when researching heroes, as more will hopefully be added in the future!</p>
		<div class = "AboutLine"></div>
		<p class = "AboutText">But, regardless of what you think of this website, I'd at least like to thank you for visiting, and I hope that you enjoyed my little project. <br><br>-Danny Ortiz</p>
